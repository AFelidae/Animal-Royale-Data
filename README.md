### Introduction

//Add heatmap image

I wanted to study player behavior in a battle royale style game that pits many players against each other and tries to see who will be the last survivor among them. I wrote a program that automatically joined games and watched them recording player data. After running it for the past few weeks I amassed a considerable amount of data from over 500+ games. 

### Data Collection

Data collection was handled by two programs one that collected the data by reading values straight from the games memory, while the other would automatically join games and melee attack repeatedly to avoid getting kicked for inactivity and to have minimal impact on the other players. Each games data gets stored into a json file.
